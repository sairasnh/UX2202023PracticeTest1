        <h2>... Separating content from presentation</h2>
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>
            Using <em>&lt;em&gt;</em> and <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> tags for emphasizing and strengthening text is preferred over <i> and <b> tags because they provide semantic meaning to the content. <em>&lt;em&gt;</em> indicates emphasis, while <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> indicates strong importance. This semantic markup makes it easier for assistive technologies, search engines, and CSS styles to interpret and style the content correctly. On the other hand, <i> and <b> tags are more presentation-oriented and do not convey the same level of meaning, making the content less accessible and harder to style consistently.
