        <section>
            <h2>Writing in Google Docs</h2>
            <p>
                Google Docs provides a user-friendly, cloud-based platform for creating and editing documents. It offers a range of convenient features like real-time collaboration, easy sharing, and automatic saving. The interface is designed for intuitive text formatting, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

            <h2>Writing in an HTML Document</h2>
            <p>
                Writing in HTML involves creating content using markup tags that define the structure and presentation of a web page. While it offers more control over customization and layout compared to Google Docs, it requires a basic understanding of HTML syntax. HTML documents are typically used for web development and provide flexibility for creating diverse types of content.
